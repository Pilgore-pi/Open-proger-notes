# ProgerNotes

## ENG

The big collection of notes on IT technologies. I wrote these notes during my many-year long self education process. I studied programming, information security, system administration and computer physical components.

This vault is accumulation of official documentation, YouTube guides, educational sites and my own thoughts. The vault contains many source links, so you can check my notes or look deeper, if you want.

I was trying to understand the IT concepts by writing my thougths on paper, then in Word and, finally,  in Obsidian. I love to dig into programming and learn it in great detail. Thus, here you can find many interesting and deep details that are not described well on an average programming related site.
