## General

- [ ] Switch to TDD development methodology. Cover all code by unit-tests BEFORE adding any new functionality
- [ ] ...

## Assemblies

- [ ] Finished

- [ ] Develop a CLI for managing app assembling actions
- [ ] Implement assembly logic. It must support:
  - [ ] specific platform building
  - [ ] picking modules and submodules that are included in the final build
  - [ ] choosing compiling mode (single binary, separate dynamic libraries)
  - [ ] assembling every dynamic library or program independently (\* programs: all GUIs and other programs with entry point)
  - [ ] self rebuilding (compiling source code of the Assemblies project, closing current running instance and starting new compiled version)
- [ ] Develop a separate CLI for interacting with app functionality
- [ ] Develop a special tag system that specifies global application assembling parameters
  - [ ] Tag `//# Platform-dependent: { Windows, Linux, MacOS } ` (`Unix = Linux + MacOS`)
  - [ ] Tag `//# Platform-independent`
  - [ ] Tag `//# Requires <UpperLevel namespace>` (`//# Requires UpperLevel.OS`, `//# Requires UpperLevel.Data.Converters`). Determines how to link dependencies in application building process
  - [ ] Tag `//# `

- [ ] Encryption
  - [ ] Define an encrypting API or wrap existing functionality in it
    - [ ] Implement modern end effective symmetrical algorithm (AES) or wrap existing functionality
    - [ ] Implement modern end effective asymmetrical algorithm (RSA) or wrap existing functionality

### Files

- [ ] Create File and Directory models. Do not create specific file format models, because its too complex, instead define universal logic for managing metadata properties and common file structure elements. For example, all bitmap images has pixels and compression mechanisms
- [ ] 

### Forms

- [ ] Create crossplatform forms that can be injected in other forms as structural element

  - [ ] **Key-value object**. 
  - [ ] **Text table**. Table with no text format. Cell data is treated as string. Parameters: CanSortColumnX, CanChangeColumnOrder, AvailableOperations, AlternateRowsColors, AlternateColumnColors, DataSource (file with data in one of valid formats, function result, activity result, program result)
  - [ ] **Validation table**. Supports column typification and validation. Every column element has property `delegate bool Validator<T>(T value)`
  - [ ] **Formatted table**. Extended text table that supports fonts, colors, cell combining and splitting
  - [ ] **Formatted validation table**. Combines functionality of all tables
  - [ ] **Text tree**. Table that supports nested table rows. Parameters: AllowManyColumns, MaxDepth, UnwrapDefaultLevel
  - [ ] **Validation tree**
  - [ ] **Formatted tree**
  - [ ] **Formatted validation tree**
  - [ ] **Authorization view**. Parameters: Login, Password, LoginRegex, PasswordRegex, IncorrectLoginFormatMessage, IncorrectPasswordFormatMessage, RegisteredLogins, RegisteredPasswordHashes
  - [ ] **Registration view**. Parameters: RepeatLoginTimes=1, RepeatPasswordTimes=2, LoginRegex, PasswordRegex, IncorrectLoginFormatMessage, IncorrectPasswordFormatMessage
  - [ ] **Validation text box**. Text box with customizable validator
  - [ ] **Validation date-time picker**. Allows to pick a date-time or a date-time span. Parameters: DateFormat={DateTime, DateOnly, TimeOnly}, SpanMode=false
  - [ ] **CodeEditor**. Code parser. Only parses the code with specific syntax, no analyzer (at least simple)?. It should allow to use many cursors. Parameters: Syntax={Text, RegExp, C\#, C++, JavaScript, Python, Markdown, RTF, ...}, ColorScheme={\<one of defaults\>, customObject}
  - [ ] **SeriEditor**. Serialization format parser. Allows to change non-table data in UI. Supported formats: JSON, XML, YAML (all in redered representation)
  - [ ] **ImageEditor**. Simple (raster only?) image editor
  - [ ] **Font picker**. Allows to pick a font family, font size and font style. Font families should dynamically load from file system to allow custom fonts
  - [ ] **Color picker**
  - [ ] **Func viewer**. Displays function chart. Values for X component can be calculated by preset or by custom function `X(?)`. `f(x) = y(x(?))`

  - [ ] For all of these views create "settings button" that allows to change parameters of the view in runtime. Every of those views which supports this feature has to have property "`ShowSettingsButton`"

### Net

- [ ] Communication

### OS

- [ ] Keyboard and mouse

- [ ] Screen

- [ ] OS info

### Text

- [ ] `CharExtensions.cs`
- [ ] `StringExtensions.cs`
- [ ] `SourceCodeExtensions.cs`
    - [ ] Change notation function. Allows to change variable name notation (`var_one_1`, `VarOne1`, `VAR_ONE_1`, `var one 1`)
    - [ ] Notation function has to provide adding prefixes and postfixes (`_var_one_1`)
- [ ] `Chars.cs` Create set of static methods that return special symbols that cannot be typed using keyboard

## GUI

### AppInstaller

- [ ] Finished



### ActivityDesigner

- [ ] Finished

### ComfortExplorer

- [ ] Create Comfort explorer with highly adjustable properties. Functionality:

  - [ ] **View modes**: Vertical file list, table with movable columns, tree view
  
  - [ ] **Scale adjustment**: allow to change scale by scrolling wheel
  
  - [ ] **Column management**: Columns can be added, removed or **created**. Custom columns should represent a function that takes a file and returns one of its charachteristics
  
  - [ ] Explorer must support **LINQ-like language** for CRUD operations on files. Create special view for queries
  
  - [ ] Explorer must support **metadata viewer** that shows metadata of a single file or a set of files with the same type
    - [ ] Add edit mode that allows to change metadata of the file
  
  - [ ] Add **context menu** with these items:
    - [ ] Show metadata
    - [ ] Pack
    - [ ] Convert... (change file format by converting data and metadata)
    - [ ] Merge custom context menu with system context menu
    - [ ] Open with app (similar to OS function)
    - [ ] Open as format... Allows to open file as it would be of another format
  
  - [ ] Status panel:
    - [ ] size of selected files and all files in the current location
    - [ ] amount of elements in the present location
  
  - [ ] Preview panel: allows to preview file contents
    - [ ] Edit mode: allows to edit the contents using one of built-in viewers
  
  - [ ] Add different themes for the explorer
