There are two classes that lives in different assemblies and different namespaces.

WinForms: use following namespace declaration, make sure Main is marked with `[STAThread]` attribute:

```cs
using System.Windows.Forms;
```

WPF: use following namespace declaration

```cs
using System.Windows;
```

console: add reference to System.Windows.Forms, use following namespace declaration, make sure Main is marked with `[STAThread]` attribute. Step-by-step guide in another answer

```cs
using System.Windows.Forms;
```

To copy an exact string (literal in this case):

```cs
Clipboard.SetText("Hello, clipboard");
```

To copy the contents of a textbox either use `TextBox.Copy()` or get text first and then set clipboard value:

```
Clipboard.SetText(txtClipboard.Text);
```
